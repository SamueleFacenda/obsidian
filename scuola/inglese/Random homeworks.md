1. Moore's law, la so.
2. Intel prints individual lines smaller
than a virus and 1000 times thinner
than a human hair, and
manufactures microprocessors with
some features as thin as five
atomic layers.
3. There are phisical limits
4. Microchips are built up, layer by
layer, through a process called
photolithography. A layer of silicon,
metal, or some other material that
will make up the circuitry is
deposited on a chip and coated
with light-sensitive material called
photoresist.
5. The chip components are
significantly smaller than the
wavelength of the visible light used
to make them.
6. Because devices like smartphones
and tablets don't have the raw
processing power of the latest
desktop and laptop computers but
they still allow users to access the
applications and data they need.

1. Back in the 1969 at Intel we have designed the first central prosessing unit condensed in one single chip, but 1961 was the beginning, when I've created the first integrated circuit.
2. It predicts the power of the microprocessor in the years, based on  optimization and miniaturization of the process
3.
